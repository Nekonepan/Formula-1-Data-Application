    "TEXT": "Born in Melbourne, just a stone's throw away from the Australian Grand Prix venue, a young Oscar Piastri's dreams of one day racing in Formula 1 were ignited by the sport's star drivers roaring around his local streets, otherwise known as Albert Park.\n\nBut it would take huge commitment and sacrifice to turn that dream into a reality, with a move to Europe - made by the likes of fellow countrymen Mark Webber and Daniel Ricciardo before him - the only way to go up against the best and catch the attention of the sport's decision-makers.\n\nUsing success on the Australian karting scene as a springboard, Piastri continued to learn the craft in championships across Europe, before getting his first taste of single-seater competition as a 15-year-old - two podium finishes in F4 UAE a sign of things to come.\n\nFrom there, success flowed. British F4 runner-up. Formula Renault champion. F3 champion. F2 champion (by more than 50 points). Piastri did not simply climb the junior single-seater ladder, he charged up it to knock loudly on the F1 door.\n\nSo impressive was Piastri that two F1 teams squabbled over his services for 2023, adding a new dimension to the driver market and so-called 'silly season'. McLaren, and not long-time backers Alpine, won out and their rookie repaid them in spades, taking two podiums in a highly impressive debut campaign.\n\nIt was no flash in the pan. In 2024 Piastri proved vital in McLaren securing their first constructors' title since 1998, pushing more experienced team mate Lando Norris all the way and scoring Grand Prix wins in Hungary and Azerbaijan to finish fourth in the driver standings."

    "TEXT": "Lando Norris may not be named after Star Wars rebel Lando Calrissian - his Mum just liked the moniker - but he has flair and fighting spirit in bountiful supply. \n\nMcLaren had the British teenager on their books for two years before fast-tracking him into F1's galaxy of stars in 2019. A firecracker in his junior career, with a penchant for pole positions and wheel-to-wheel tussles, Norris didn't let them down. \n\nPaired with the highly-rated - and far more experienced - Carlos Sainz, his rookie season was impressive, Norris edging the Spaniard in their head-to-head qualifying battle, scoring points 11 times, and only narrowly missing out on a top-10 championship placing. \n\nA maiden podium came in 2020, with more following in the subsequent two seasons - he narrowly missed out on a win at Russia 2021 - as he dominated another more senior team mate, Daniel Ricciardo, to firmly establish himself in F1's top tier. \n\nIt was the 2024 season that finally brought Norris his breakthrough win - along with three more - as he became the biggest challenger to Max Verstappen's drivers' crown and led McLaren to their first constructors' title since 1998. \n\nAway from the track, Norris brims with a modest charm and an artistic side sees him design and paint his own race gear as a hobby. The focus for the future is allying artistry and ambition on track as McLaren rely on the promise of youth to take them back to the top. \n\nNorris hopes the downforce will be with him…"

    "TEXT": "He's the driver with the motto: “If in doubt, go flat out”.\n\nGeorge Russell has lived by it throughout his F1 career to date, out-qualifying seasoned team mate Robert Kubica at all 21 Grands Prix in his rookie season, putting Williams back on the podium in 2021, and landing his first race win with Mercedes in 2022.\n\nThat brilliant baseline speed served Russell well as he totted up titles on his way to Formula 1. The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure.\n\nSpotting his potential, world champions Mercedes swooped to sign him to their junior programme in 2017, when Russell already had a DTM deal on the table. He banked more experience with practice sessions with Force India and tests for the Silver Arrows, before landing his Mercedes-powered Williams race drive.\n\nA refusal to cede ground to his rivals - and commitment to a tricky pass - underpins Russell's winning mentality. And it's what got him the call-up to replace Lewis Hamilton for a one-off Mercedes appearance for Sakhir 2020 when the reigning champ was struck down by Covid-19.\n\nThat star turn saw Russell miss out on pole by just 0.026s and then outrace Mercedes stalwart Valtteri Bottas. Only a bungled pit stop and a heart-breaking late puncture prevented a near-certain maiden win for the up-and-coming super-sub.\n\nHe kept his head down at Williams in 2021, scoring his first points and podium, all the while keeping his eye on the bigger prize. Having proved himself a hard worker and a tenacious talent, that prize arrived in the form of a chance to take on compatriot and seven-time champion Hamilton in identical machinery.\n\nIt was an opportunity Russell has relished, and he took his first F1 win - and Mercedes' only 2022 victory - in Brazil. The 2023 season proved tougher, but he was again atop the podium twice in 2024 and for 2025 he leads the team following Hamilton's departure for Ferrari.\nAnd if the Silver Arrows can bounce back and provide a truly competitive car, a title bid surely beckons - a huge challenge, but as always, 'Russell the Rocket' will be going flat out."

Winning back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1 racing.\n\nStepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits - and earning himself a money-can't-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes of the Scuderia's last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen.\n\nThere he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go wheel-to-wheel with established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on Ferrari's hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero - who then became the first man to out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in crushing fashion the following year.\n\nThe 2020 and '21 seasons bore little fruit for Ferrari, but Leclerc maintained his resolve to emerge a true title contender in 2022. With three wins, 11 podiums and nine pole positions, he was the only man able to consistently take the fight to champion Max Verstappen - a feat he and the Scuderia were sadly unable to repeat in subsequent campaigns.\n\nOut of the car, Leclerc is modest and thoughtful - but then he is on his own very personal mission. This exciting young talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend and mentor Jules Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015.\n\nOn the evidence so far, he is doing them both proud."

But the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster talent have remained - and the victories have kept on coming.\n\nThey led to his first F1 drivers' crown after that now legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021 and he followed that up with a powerhouse title defence in 2022. An epic third successive championship triumph featured a record 19 wins from 23 Grands Prix, and he held on for a fourth in 2024, despite Red Bull falling off the pace towards the end of the campaign.\n\nThe son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick karting Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out of Dad's house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his family, and though he's not afraid to speak his mind, he can still be surprisingly shy.\n\nHaving become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the expectations for the new generation's leading light are sky high - but with Verstappen there's a feeling that the sky's the limit."
