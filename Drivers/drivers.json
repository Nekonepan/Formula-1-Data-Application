    "TEXT": "Born in Melbourne, just a stone's throw away from the Australian Grand Prix venue, a young Oscar Piastri's dreams of one day racing in Formula 1 were ignited by the sport's star drivers roaring around his local streets, otherwise known as Albert Park.\n\nBut it would take huge commitment and sacrifice to turn that dream into a reality, with a move to Europe - made by the likes of fellow countrymen Mark Webber and Daniel Ricciardo before him - the only way to go up against the best and catch the attention of the sport's decision-makers.\n\nUsing success on the Australian karting scene as a springboard, Piastri continued to learn the craft in championships across Europe, before getting his first taste of single-seater competition as a 15-year-old - two podium finishes in F4 UAE a sign of things to come.\n\nFrom there, success flowed. British F4 runner-up. Formula Renault champion. F3 champion. F2 champion (by more than 50 points). Piastri did not simply climb the junior single-seater ladder, he charged up it to knock loudly on the F1 door.\n\nSo impressive was Piastri that two F1 teams squabbled over his services for 2023, adding a new dimension to the driver market and so-called 'silly season'. McLaren, and not long-time backers Alpine, won out and their rookie repaid them in spades, taking two podiums in a highly impressive debut campaign.\n\nIt was no flash in the pan. In 2024 Piastri proved vital in McLaren securing their first constructors' title since 1998, pushing more experienced team mate Lando Norris all the way and scoring Grand Prix wins in Hungary and Azerbaijan to finish fourth in the driver standings."
